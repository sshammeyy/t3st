      <h3>Mastercard Cybersecurity virtual experience program on Forage - September 2025</h3>
      <p>
       Completed a job simulation where I served as an analyst on Mastercard’s Security Awareness Team 
Helped identify and report security threats such as phishing 
Analyzed and identified which areas of the business needed more robust security training and implemented training courses and procedures for those teams <strong>[brief summary of what it does]</strong>. 
        I recently participated in Mastercard's job simulation on the Forage platform, and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to participate on a Security Awareness team at Mastercard.
I worked on a project to identify phishing emails and design security awareness training courses. Through this job simulation, I built my skills in problem-solving, data analysis, and data presentation and practiced them in a real-world context.
Doing this program confirmed that I really enjoy working in cybersecurity and I'm excited to apply these skills on a Security Awareness team at a company like Mastercard.</strong>.
